## Project Aims
- **Improve Healthcare**: Deliver an integrated system that leverages AI for better health management.
- **Medication Reminders**: Notify patients when to take their medication to avoid missed doses.
- **Health Data Analysis**: Use predictive analytics to forecast and prevent potential health issues.
- **Inclusive Features**: Include functionalities that accommodate all types of users, including those with special needs.

## Deliverables
- **Web Application**: An integrated platform for individual healthcare management.
- **Mobile Application**: Ensures flexibility and accessibility.
- **Health Data Analysis System**: AI-based insights and recommendations.
- **Wearable Device Support**: Real-time health indicators.

## Problem Definition
Patients, especially the elderly and those with disabilities, often struggle with remembering medication schedules and managing symptoms. The project will include features such as:
- Medication reminders.
- Symptom tracking.
- Health data analytics.
- Integration with wearable devices.

## Proposed Solution
Design a smart healthcare assistant featuring a user-friendly interface with state-of-the-art technology. Services will include:
- Reminders for medication.
- Predictive health analytics.
- Accessibility tools.

Technologies to be utilized include React, MongoDB, and Firebase.
